--- abstract

The Authorization API enables Policy Decision Points (PDPs) and Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs) to communicate authorization requests and decisions to each other without requiring knowledge of each other's inner workings. The Authorization API is served by the PDP and is called by the PEP. The Authorization API includes an Evaluation endpoint, which provides specific access decisions. Other endpoints may be added in the future for other scenarios, including searching for subjects, resources or actions.

# Introduction
Computational services often implement access control within their components by separating Policy Decision Points (PDPs) from Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs). PDPs and PEPs are defined in XACML ({{XACML}}) and NIST's ABAC SP 800-162. Communication between PDPs and PEPs follows similar patterns across different software and services that require or provide authorization information. The Authorization API described in this document enables different providers to offer PDP and PEP capabilities without having to bind themselves to one particular implementation of a PDP or PEP.

# Model
The Authorization API is a transport-agnostic API published by the PDP, to which the PEP acts as a client. Possible bindings of this specification, such as HTTPS or gRPC, are described in Transport ({{transport}}).

Authorization for the Authorization API itself is out of scope for this document, since authorization for APIs is well-documented elsewhere. For example, the Authorization API's HTTPS binding MAY support authorization using an `Authorization` header, using a `basic` or `bearer` token. Support for OAuth 2.0 ({{RFC6749}}) is RECOMMENDED. 

# Features
The core feature of the Authorization API is the Access Evaluation API, which enables a PEP to find out if a specific request can be permitted to access a specific resource. The following are non-normative examples:

- Can Alice view document #123?
- Can Alice view document #123 at 16:30 on Tuesday, June 11, 2024?
- Can a manager print?

# API Version
This document describes the API version 1.0. Any updates to this API through subsequent revisions of this document or other documents MAY augment this API, but MUST NOT modify the API described here. Augmentation MAY include additional API methods or additional parameters to existing API methods, additional authorization mechanisms, or additional optional headers in API requests. All API methods for version 1.0 MUST be immediately preceded by the relative URL path `/v1/`.

# Information Model
The information model for requests and responses include the following entities: Subject, Action, Resource, Context, and Decision. These are all defined below.

## Subject {#subject}
A Subject is the user or robotic principal about whom the Authorization API is being invoked. The Subject may be requesting access at the time the Authorization API is invoked.

A Subject is a JSON ({{RFC8259}}) object that contains two REQUIRED keys, `type` and `id`, which have a value typed `string`, and an OPTIONAL key, `properties`, with a value of a JSON object.

`type`:
: REQUIRED. A `string` value that specifies the type of the Subject.

`id`:
: REQUIRED. A `string` value containing the unique identifier of the Subject, scoped to the `type`.

`properties`:
: OPTIONAL. A JSON object containing any number of key-value pairs, which can be used to express additional properties of a Subject.

The following is a non-normative example of a Subject:

~~~ json
{
  "type": "user",
  "id": "alice@acmecorp.com"
}
~~~
{: #subject-example title="Example Subject"}

### Subject Properties {#subject-properties}
Many authorization systems are stateless, and expect the client (PEP) to pass in any properties or attributes that are expected to be used in the evaluation of the authorization policy. To satisfy this requirement, Subjects MAY include zero or more additional attributes as key-value pairs, under the `properties` object.

An attribute can be single-valued or multi-valued. It can be a primitive type (string, boolean, number) or a complex type such as a JSON object or JSON array.

The following is a non-normative example of a Subject which adds a string-valued `department` property:

~~~ json
{
  "type": "user",
  "id": "alice@acmecorp.com",
  "properties": {
    "department": "Sales"
  }
}
~~~
{: #subject-department-example title="Example Subject with Additional Property"}

To increase interoperability, a few common properties are specified below:

#### IP Address {#subject-ip-address}
The IP Address of the Subject, identified by an `ip_address` field, whose value is a textual representation of an IP Address, as defined in `Textual Conventions for Internet Network Addresses` {{RFC4001}}.

The following is a non-normative example of a subject which adds the `ip_address` property:

~~~ json
{
  "type": "user",
  "id": "alice@acmecorp.com",
  "properties": {
    "department": "Sales",
    "ip_address": "172.217.22.14"
  }
}
~~~
{: #subject-ip-address-example title="Example Subject with IP Address"}


#### Device ID {#subject-device-id}
The Device Identifier of the Subject, identified by a `device_id` field, whose value is a string representation of the device identifier.

The following is a non-normative example of a subject which adds the `device_id` property:

~~~ json
{
  "type": "user",
  "id": "alice@acmecorp.com",
  "properties": {
    "department": "Sales",
    "ip_address": "172.217.22.14",
    "device_id": "8:65:ee:17:7e:0b"
  }
}
~~~
{: #subject-device-id-example title="Example Subject with Device ID"}

## Resource {#resource}
A Resource is the target of an access request. It is a JSON ({{RFC8259}}) object that is constructed similar to a Subject entity. It has the follow keys:

`type`:
: REQUIRED. A `string` value that specifies the type of the Resource.

`id`:
: REQUIRED. A `string` value containing the unique identifier of the Resource, scoped to the `type`.

`properties`:
: OPTIONAL. A JSON object containing any number of key-value pairs, which can be used to express additional properties of a Resource.

### Examples (non-normative)

The following is a non-normative example of a Resource with a `type` and a simple `id`:

~~~ json
{
  "type": "book",
  "id": "123"
}
~~~
{: #resource-example title="Example Resource"}

The following is a non-normative example of a Resource containing a `library_record` property, that is itself a JSON object:

~~~ json
{
  "type": "book",
  "id": "123",
  "properties": {
    "library_record":{
      "title": "AuthZEN in Action",
      "isbn": "978-0593383322"
    }
  }
}
~~~
{: #resource-example-structured title="Example Resource with Additional Property"}

## Action {#action}
An Action is the type of access that the requester intends to perform.

Action is a JSON ({{RFC8259}}) object that contains a REQUIRED `name` key with a `string` value, and an OPTIONAL `properties` key with a JSON object value.

`name`:
: REQUIRED. The name of the Action.

`properties`:
: OPTIONAL. A JSON object containing any number of key-value pairs, which can be used to express additional properties of an Action.

The following is a non-normative example of an action:

~~~ json
{
  "name": "can_read"
}
~~~
{: #action-example title="Example Action"}

## Context {#context}
The Context object is a set of attributes that represent environmental or contextual data about the request such as time of day. It is a JSON ({{RFC8259}}) object.

The following is a non-normative example of a Context:

~~~ json
{
  "time": "1985-10-26T01:22-07:00"
}
~~~
{: #context-example title="Example Context"}

# Access Evaluation API {#access-evaluation-api}

The Access Evaluation API defines the message exchange pattern between a client (PEP) and an authorization service (PDP) for executing a single access evaluation.

## The Access Evaluation API Request {#access-evaluation-request}
The Access Evaluation request is a 4-tuple constructed of the four previously defined entities:

`subject`:
: REQUIRED. The subject (or principal) of type Subject

`action`:
: REQUIRED. The action (or verb) of type Action.

`resource`:
: REQUIRED. The resource of type Resource.

`context`:
: OPTIONAL. The context (or environment) of type Context.

### Example (non-normative)

~~~ json
{
  "subject": {
    "type": "user",
    "id": "alice@acmecorp.com"
  },
  "resource": {
    "type": "account",
    "id": "123"
  },
  "action": {
    "name": "can_read",
    "properties": {
      "method": "GET"
    }
  },
  "context": {
    "time": "1985-10-26T01:22-07:00"
  }
}
~~~
{: #request-example title="Example Request"}

## The Access Evaluation API Response {#access-evaluation-response}
The simplest form of a response is simply a boolean representing a Decision, indicated by a `"decision"` field. 

`decision`:
: REQUIRED. A boolean value that specifies whether the Decision is to allow or deny the operation.

In this specification, assuming the evaluation was successful, there are only 2 possible responses:

- `true`: The access request is permitted to go forward.
- `false`: The access request is denied and MUST NOT be permitted to go forward.

The response object MUST contain this boolean-valued Decision key.

### Access Evaluation Decision {#decision}
The following is a non-normative example of a simple Decision:

~~~ json
{
  "decision": true
}
~~~
{: #decision-example title="Example Decision"}

### Additional Context in a Response
In addition to a `"decision"`, a response may contain a `"context"` field which can be any JSON object.  This context can convey additional information that can be used by the PEP as part of the decision evaluation process. Examples include:

- XACML's notion of "advice" and "obligations"
- Hints for rendering UI state
- Instructions for step-up authentication

### Example Context
An implementation MAY follow a structured approach to `"context"`, in which it presents the reasons that an authorization request failed.

- A list of identifiers representing the items (policies, graph nodes, tuples) that were used in the decision-making process.
- A list of reasons as to why access is permitted or denied.

#### Reasons
Reasons MAY be provided by the PDP. 

##### Reason Field {#reason-field}
A Reason Field is a JSON object that has keys and values of type `string`. The following are non-normative examples of Reason Field objects:

~~~ json
{
  "en": "location restriction violation"
}
~~~
{: #reason-example title="Example Reason"}

##### Reason Object {#reason-object}
A Reason Object specifies a particular reason. It is a JSON object that has the following fields:

`id`:
: REQUIRED. A string value that specifies the reason within the scope of a particular response.

`reason_admin`:
: OPTIONAL. The reason, which MUST NOT be shared with the user, but useful for administrative purposes that indicates why the access was denied. The value of this field is a Reason Field object ({{reason-field}}).

`reason_user`:
: OPTIONAL. The reason, which MAY be shared with the user that indicates why the access was denied. The value of this field is a Reason Field object ({{reason-field}}).

The following is a non-normative example of a Reason Object:

~~~ json
{
  "id": "0",
  "reason_admin": {
    "en": "Request failed policy C076E82F"
  },
  "reason_user": {
    "en-403": "Insufficient privileges. Contact your administrator",
    "es-403": "Privilegios insuficientes. Póngase en contacto con su administrador"
  }
}
~~~
{: #example-reason-object title="Example of a Reason Object"}

### Sample Response with additional context (non-normative)

~~~ json
{
  "decision": true,
  "context": {
    "id": "0",
    "reason_admin": {
      "en": "Request failed policy C076E82F"
    },
    "reason_user": {
      "en-403": "Insufficient privileges. Contact your administrator",
      "es-403": "Privilegios insuficientes. Póngase en contacto con su administrador"
    }
  }
}
~~~
{: #response-with-context-example title="Example Response with Context"}

# Access Evaluations API {#access-evaluations-api}

The Access Evaluations API defines the message exchange pattern between a client (PEP) and an authorization service (PDP) for evaluating multiple access evaluations within the scope of a single message exchange (also known as "boxcarring" requests).

## The Access Evaluations API Request {#access-evaluations-request}

The Access Evaluation API Request builds on the information model presented in {{information-model}} and the 4-tuple defined in the Access Evaluation Request ({{access-evaluation-request}}).

To send multiple access evaluation requests in a single message, the caller MAY add an `evaluations` key to the request. The `evaluations` key is an array which contains a list of JSON objects, each typed as the 4-tuple as defined in the Access Evaluation Request ({{access-evaluation-request}}), and specifying a discrete request.

If an `evaluations` array is NOT present, the Access Evaluations Request behaves in a backwards-compatible manner with the (single) Access Evaluation API Request ({{access-evaluation-request}}).

If an `evaluations` array IS present and contains one or more objects, these form distinct requests that the PDP will evaluate. These requests are independent from each other, and may be executed sequentially or in parallel, left to the discretion of each implementation.

If the `evaluations` array IS present and contains one or more objects, the top-level `subject`, `action`, `resource`, and `context` keys (4-tuple) in the request object MAY be omitted. However, if one or more of these values is present, they provide default values for their respective fields in the evaluation requests. This behavior is described in {{default-values}}.

The following is a non-normative example for specifying three requests, with no default values:

~~~json
{
  "evaluations": [
    {
      "subject": {
        "type": "user",
        "id": "alice@acmecorp.com"
      },
      "action": {
        "name": "can_read"
      },
      "resource": {
        "type": "document",
        "id": "boxcarring.md"
      },
      "context":{
        "time": "2024-05-31T15:22-07:00"
      }
    },
    {
      "subject": {
        "type": "user",
        "id": "alice@acmecorp.com"
      },
      "action": {
        "name": "can_read"
      },
      "resource": {
        "type": "document",
        "id": "subject-search.md"
      },
      "context":{
        "time": "2024-05-31T15:22-07:00"
      }
    },
    {
      "subject": {
        "type": "user",
        "id": "alice@acmecorp.com"
      },
      "action": {
        "name": "can_read"
      },
      "resource": {
        "type": "document",
        "id": "resource-search.md"
      },
      "context":{
        "time": "2024-05-31T15:22-07:00"
      }
    }
  ]
}
~~~

### Default values

While the example above provides the most flexibility in specifying distinct values in each request for every evaluation, it is common for boxcarred requests to share one or more values of the 4-tuple. For example, evaluations MAY all refer to a single subject, and/or have the same contextual (environmental) attributes.

Default values offer a more compact syntax that avoids over-duplication of request data.

If any of the top-level `subject`, `action`, `resource`, and `context` keys are provided, the value of the top-level key is treated as the default value for the 4-tuples specified in the `evaluations` array. If a top-level key is specified in the 4-tuples present in the `evaluations` array then the value of that will take precedence over these default values.

The following is a non-normative example for specifying three requests that refer to a single subject and context:

~~~json
{
  "subject": {
    "type": "user",
    "id": "alice@acmecorp.com"
  },
  "context":{
    "time": "2024-05-31T15:22-07:00"
  },
  "evaluations": [
    {
      "action": {
        "name": "can_read"
      },
      "resource": {
        "type": "document",
        "id": "boxcarring.md"
      }
    },
    {
      "action": {
        "name": "can_read"
      },
      "resource": {
        "type": "document",
        "id": "subject-search.md"
      }
    },
    {
      "action": {
        "name": "can_read"
      },
      "resource": {
        "type": "document",
        "id": "resource-search.md"
      }
    }
  ]
}
~~~

The following is a non-normative example for specifying three requests that refer to a single `subject` and `context`, with a default value for `action`, that is overridden by the third request:

~~~json
{
  "subject": {
    "type": "user",
    "id": "alice@acmecorp.com"
  },
  "context":{
    "time": "2024-05-31T15:22-07:00"
  },
  "action": {
    "name": "can_read"
  },
  "evaluations": [
    {
      "resource": {
        "type": "document",
        "id": "boxcarring.md"
      }
    },
    {
      "resource": {
        "type": "document",
        "id": "subject-search.md"
      }
    },
    {
      "action": {
        "name": "can_edit"
      },
      "resource": {
        "type": "document",
        "id": "resource-search.md"
      }
    }
  ]
}
~~~

### Evaluations options

The `evaluations` request payload includes an OPTIONAL `options` key, with a JSON value containing a set of key-value pairs.

This provides a general-purpose mechanism for providing caller-supplied metadata on how the request is to be executed.

One such option conrtols *evaluation semantics*, and is described in {{evaluations-semantics}}.

A non-normative example of the `options` field is shown below:

~~~json
{
  "evaluations": [...],
  "options": {
    "evaluation_semantics": "execute_all",
    "another_option": "value"
  }
}
~~~

#### Evaluations semantics

By default, every request in the `evaluations` array is executed and a response returned in the same array order. This is the most common use-case for boxcarring multiple evaluation requests in a single payload.

With that said, three evaluation semantics are supported:

1. *Execute all of the requests (potentially in parallel), return all of the results.* Any failure can be denoted by `decision: false` and MAY provide a reason code in the context.
2. *Deny on first denial (or failure).* This semantic could be desired if a PEP wants to issue a few requests in a particular order, with any denial (error, or `decision: false`) "short-circuiting" the evaluations call and returning on the first denial. This essentially works like the `&&` operator in programming languages.
3. *Permit on first permit.* This is the converse "short-circuiting" semantic, working like the `||` operator in programming languages.

To select the desired evaluations semantic, a caller can pass in `options.evaluations_semantic` with exactly one of the following values:

  * `execute_all`
  * `deny_on_first_deny`
  * `permit_on_first_permit`

`execute_all` is the default semantic, so an `evaluations` request without the `options.evaluations_semantic` flag will execute using this semantic.

##### Example: Evaluate `read` action for three documents using all three semantics

Execute all requests:

~~~json
{
  "subject": {
    "type": "user",
    "id": "alice@example.com"
  },
  "action": {
    "name": "read"
  },
  "options": {
    "evaluations_semantic": "execute_all"
  },
  "evaluations": [
    {

    }

## Access Evaluations API Response {#access-evaluations-response}

Like the request format, the Access Evaluations Response format for an Access Evaluations Request adds an `evaluations` array that lists the decisions in the same order they were provided in the `evaluations` array in the request. Each value of the evaluations array is typed as an Access Evaluation Response ({{access-evaluation-response}}).

In case the `evaluations` array is present, it is RECOMMENDED that the `decision` key of the response will be omitted. If present, it can be ignored by the caller.

The following is a non-normative example of a Access Evaluations Response to an Access Evaluations Request containing three evaluation objects:

~~~json
{
  "evaluations": [
    {
      "decision": true
    },
    {
      "decision": false,
      "context": {
        "reason": "resource not found"

### Errors

There are two types of errors, and they are handled differently:
1. Transport-level errors, or errors that pertain to the entire payload.
2. Errors in individual evaluations.

The first type of error is handled at the transport level. For example, for the HTTP binding, the 4XX and 5XX codes indicate a general error that pertains to the entire payload, as described in Transport ({{transport}}).

The second type of error is handled at the payload level. Decisions default to *closed* (i.e. `false`), but the `context` field can include errors that are specific to that request.

The following is a non-normative example of a response to an Access Evaluations Request containing three evaluation objects, two of them demonstrating how errors can be returned for two of the evaluation requests:

~~~json
{
  "evaluations": [
    {
      "decision": true
    },
    {
      "decision": false,
      "context": {
        "error": {
          "status": 404,
          "message": "Resource not found"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "decision": false,
      "context": {
        "reason": "Subject is a viewer of the resource"
      }
    }
  ]
}

# Subject Search API {#subject-search-api}

The Subject Search API defines the message exchange pattern between a client (PEP) and an authorization service (PDP) for returning all of the subjects that match the search criteria.

The Subject Search API is based on the Access Evaluation information model, but omits the Subject ID.

## The Subject Search API Request {#subject-search-request}

The Subject Search request is a 3-tuple constructed of three previously defined entities:

`subject`:
: REQUIRED. The subject (or principal) of type Subject.  NOTE that the Subject type is REQUIRED but the Subject ID can be omitted, and if present, is IGNORED.

`action`:
: REQUIRED. The action (or verb) of type Action.

`resource`:
: REQUIRED. The resource of type Resource.

`context`:
: OPTIONAL. Contextual data about the request.

`page`:
: OPTIONAL. A page token for paged requests.

### Example (non-normative)

The following payload defines a request for the subjects of type `user` that can perform the `can_read` action on the resource of type `account` and ID `123`.

~~~ json
{
  "subject": {
    "type": "user"
  },
  "action": {
    "name": "can_read",
  },
  "resource": {

    "id": "123"
  },
  "context": {
    "time": "2024-10-26T01:22-07:00"
  }
}
~~~
{: #subject-search-request-example title="Example Request"}

## The Subject Search API Response {#subject-search-response}

The response is a paged array of Subjects.

~~~ json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "type": "user",
      "id": "alice@acmecorp.com"
    },

      "id": "bob@acmecorp.com"
    }
  ],
  "page": {
    "next_token": ""
  }
}
~~~

### Paged requests

A response that needs to be split across page boundaries returns a non-empty `page.next_token`.

#### Example

~~~ json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "type": "user",
      "id": "alice@acmecorp.com"

    }
  ],
  "page": {
    "next_token": "alsehrq3495u8"
  }
}
~~~

To retrieve the next page, provide `page.next_token` in the next request:

~~~ json
{
  "subject": {
    "type": "user"
  },

# Policy Decision Point Metadata {#pdp-metadata}

Policy Decision Points can have metadata describing their configuration. 

## Data structure {#pdp-metadata-data}

The following Policy Decision Point metadata parameters are used by this specification and are registered in the IANA "AuthZEN PDP Metadata" registry established in Section 11.1 of [[this specification]].

### Endpoint Parameters {#pdp-metadata-data-endpoint}

issuer:
: REQUIRED. The policy decision point's issuer identifier, which is a URL that uses the "https" scheme and has no query or fragment components. Policy Decision Point metadata is published at a location that is ".well-known" according to RFC 5785 [RFC5785] derived from this issuer identifier, as described in Section 11.2 of [[this specification]]. The issuer identifier is used to prevent policy decision point mix-up attacks.

access_evaluation_endpoint:
: REQUIRED. URL of Policy Decision Point Access Evaluation API endpoint

access_evaluations_endpoint:
: OPTIONAL. URL of Policy Decision Point Access Evaluations API endpoint

search_endpoint:
: OPTIONAL. URL of Policy Decision Point Search API endpoint

partial_eval_endpoint:
: OPTIONAL. URL of Policy Decision Point Partial Evaluation API endpoint

Note that the non presence of any of those parameter is sufficient for the policy enforcement point to determine that the policy decision point is not capable and therefore will not return a result for the associated API

### Support Parameters {#pdp-metadata-data-support}

search_endpoint_entity_supported:
: OPTIONAL. JSON array containing a list of strings representing entities among `subject`, `action`, and `resource`. This metadata entry MUST be present if and URL is specified in the `search_endpoint` entry.

partial_eval_entity_supported:
: OPTIONAL. JSON array containing a list of strings representing entities among `subject`, `action`, and `resource`. This metadata entry MUST be present if and URL is specified in the `partial_eval_endpoint` entry.

### Signature Parameter {#pdp-metadata-data-sig}

In addition to JSON elements, metadata values MAY also be provided as a signed_metadata value, which is a JSON Web Token [RFC7519] that asserts metadata values about the policy decision point as a bundle. A set of metadata parameters that can be used in signed metadata as claims are defined in Section 11.1 of [[this specification]]. The signed metadata MUST be digitally signed or MACed using JSON Web Signature [RFC7515] and MUST contain an iss (issuer) claim denoting the party attesting to the claims in the signed metadata.

Consumers of the metadata MAY ignore the signed metadata if they do not support this feature. If the consumer of the metadata supports signed metadata, metadata values conveyed in the signed metadata MUST take precedence over the corresponding values conveyed using plain JSON elements. Signed metadata is included in the policy decision point metadata JSON object using this OPTIONAL metadata parameter:

signed_metadata:
: A JWT containing metadata parameters about the protected resource as claims. This is a string value consisting of the entire signed JWT. A signed_metadata parameter SHOULD NOT appear as a claim in the JWT; it is RECOMMENDED to reject any metadata in which this occurs.

## Obtaining Policy Decision Point Metadata {#pdp-metadata-access}

Policy Decision Point supporting metadata MUST make a JSON document containing metadata as specified in Section 11.1 of [[this specification]]available at a URL formed by inserting a well-known URI string between the host component and the path and/or query components, if any. The well-known URI string used is `/.well-known/authzen-configuration`.

The syntax and semantics of .well-known are defined in [RFC8615]. The well-known URI path suffix used is registered in the IANA "Well-Known URIs" registry [IANA_well_known_uris].

### Policy Decision Point Metadata Request {#pdp-metadata-access-request}

A policy decision point metadata document MUST be queried using an HTTP GET request at the previously specified URL. The consumer of the metadata would make the following request when the resource identifier is https://pdp.mycompany.com:

~~~ http
GET /.well-known/authzen-configuration HTTP/1.1
Host: pdp.mycompany.com
~~~

### Policy Decision Point Metadata Response {#pdp-metadata-access-response}

The response is a set of metadata parameters about the protected resource's configuration. A successful response MUST use the 200 OK HTTP status code and return a JSON object using the application/json content type that contains a set of metadata parameters as its members that are a subset of the metadata parameters defined in Section 11.1 of [[this specification]]. Additional metadata parameters MAY be defined and used; any metadata parameters that are not understood MUST be ignored.

Parameters with multiple values are represented as JSON arrays. Parameters with zero values MUST be omitted from the response.

An error response uses the applicable HTTP status code value.

The following is a non-normative example response:

~~~ http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "issuer": "https://pdp.mycompany.com",
  "access_evaluation_endpoint": "https://pdp.mycompany.com/access/v1/evaluation",
  "search_endpoint": "https://pdp.mycompany.com/access/v1/search",
  "search_endpoint_entity_supported": [
    "subject",
    "resource"
  ]
}
~~~

### Policy Decision Point Metadata Validation

The "issuer" value returned MUST be identical to the policy decision point's issuer identifier value into which the well-known URI string was inserted to create the URL used to retrieve the metadata.  If these values are not identical, the data contained in the response MUST NOT be used.

The recipient MUST validate that any signed metadata was signed by a key belonging to the issuer and that the signature is valid. If the signature does not validate or the issuer is not trusted, the recipient SHOULD treat this as an error condition.

# Transport

This specification defines an HTTPS binding which MUST be implemented by a compliant PDP.

Additional transport bindings (e.g. gRPC) MAY be defined in the future in the form of profiles, and MAY be implemented by a PDP.

### Error Responses
The following error responses are common to all methods of the Authorization API. The error response is indicated by an HTTPS status code ({{Section 15 of RFC9110}}) that indicates error.

The following errors are indicated by the status codes defined below:

| Code | Description  | HTTPS Body Content |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| 400  | Bad Request  | An error message string |
| 401  | Unauthorized | An error message string |
| 403  | Forbidden    | An error message string |
| 500  | Internal error | An error message string |
{: #table-error-status-codes title="HTTPS Error status codes"}

Note: HTTPS errors are returned by the PDP to indicate an error condition relating to the request or its processing, and are unrelated to the outcome of an authorization decision, which is always returned with a `200` status code and a response payload.

To make this concrete:

- a `401` HTTPS status code indicates that the caller (policy enforcement point) did not properly authenticate to the PDP - for example, by omitting a required `Authorization` header, or using an invalid access token.
- the PDP indicates to the caller that the authorization request is denied by sending a response with a `200` HTTPS status code, along with a payload of `{ "decision": false }`.

### Request Identification
All requests to the API MAY have request identifiers to uniquely identify them. The API client (PEP) is responsible for generating the request identifier. If present, the request identifier SHALL be provided using the HTTPS Header `X-Request-ID`. The value of this header is an arbitrary string. The following non-normative example describes this header:

~~~ http
POST /access/v1/evaluation HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM
X-Request-ID: bfe9eb29-ab87-4ca3-be83-a1d5d8305716
~~~
{: #request-id-example title="Example HTTPS request with a Request Id Header"}

### Request Identification in a Response
A PDP responding to an Authorization API request that contains an `X-Request-ID` header MUST include a request identifier in the response. The request identifier is specified in the HTTPS Response header: `X-Request-ID`. If the PEP specified a request identifier in the request, the PDP MUST include the same identifier in the response to that request.

The following is a non-normative example of an HTTPS Response with this header:

~~~ http
HTTP/1.1 OK
Content-type: application/json
X-Request-ID: bfe9eb29-ab87-4ca3-be83-a1d5d8305716
~~~
{: #example-response-request-id title="Example HTTPS response with a Request Id Header"}

# IANA Considerations {#IANA}

This specification does not introduce any new identifiers that would require registration with IANA.

# Security Considerations {#Security}

## Communication Integrity and Confidentiality

In the ABAC architecture, the PEP-PDP connection is the most sensitive one and needs to be secured to guarantee:

 - Integrity
 - Confidentiality

As a result, the connection between the PEP and the PDP MUST be secured using the most adequate means given the choice of transport (e.g. TLS for HTTP REST).

## Policy Confidentiality and Sender Authentication

Additionally, the PDP SHOULD authenticate the calling PEP. There are several ways authentication can be established. These ways are out of scope of this specification. They MAY include:

 - Mutual TLS
 - OAuth-based authentication
 - API key

The choice and strength of either mechanism is not in scope.

Authenticating the PEP allows the PDP to avoid common attacks (such as DoS - see below) and/or reveal its internal policies. A malicious actor could craft a large number of requests to try and understand what policies the PDP is configured with. Requesting a client (PEP) be authenticated mitigates that risk.

## Trust

In ABAC, there is occasionally conversations around the trust between PEP and PDP: how can the PDP trust the PEP to send the right values in? This is a misplaced concern. The PDP must trust the PEP as ultimately, the PEP is the one responsible for enforcing the decision the PDP produces.

## Availability & Denial of Service

The PDP SHOULD apply reasonable protections to avoid common attacks tied to request payload size, the number of requests, invalid JSON, nested JSON attacks, or memory consumption. Rate limiting is one such way to address such issues.

## Differences between Unsigned and Signed Metadata

Unsigned metadata is integrity protected by use of TLS at the site where it is hosted. This means that its security is dependent upon the Internet Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) [RFC9525]. Signed metadata is additionally integrity protected by the JWS signature applied by the issuer, which is not dependent upon the Internet PKI.
When using unsigned metadata, the party issuing the metadata is the policy decision point itself. Whereas, when using signed metadata, the party issuing the metadata is represented by the iss (issuer) claim in the signed metadata. When using signed metadata, applications can make trust decisions based on the issuer that performed the signing -- information that is not available when using unsigned metadata. How these trust decisions are made is out of scope for this specification.

## Metadata Caching

Policy decision point metadata is retrieved using an HTTP GET request, as specified in Section 11.2 of [[this specification]]. Normal HTTP caching behaviors apply, meaning that the GET may retrieve a cached copy of the content, rather than the latest copy. Implementations should utlize HTTP caching directives such as Cache-Control with max-age, as defined in [RFC7234], to enable caching of retrieved metadata for appropriate time periods.

# IANA Considerations

The following registration procedure is used for the registry established by this specification.

Values are registered on a Specification Required [RFC8126] basis after a two-week review period on the oauth-ext-review@ietf.org mailing list, on the advice of one or more Designated Experts. However, to allow for the allocation of values prior to publication of the final version of a specification, the Designated Experts may approve registration once they are satisfied that the specification will be completed and published. However, if the specification is not completed and published in a timely manner, as determined by the Designated Experts, the Designated Experts may request that IANA withdraw the registration.

Registration requests sent to the mailing list for review should use an appropriate subject (e.g., "Request to register AuthZEN Policy Decision Point Metadata: example").

Within the review period, the Designated Experts will either approve or deny the registration request, communicating this decision to the review list and IANA. Denials should include an explanation and, if applicable, suggestions as to how to make the request successful. The IANA escalation process is followed when the Designated Experts are not responsive within 14 days.

Criteria that should be applied by the Designated Experts includes determining whether the proposed registration duplicates existing functionality, determining whether it is likely to be of general applicability or whether it is useful only for a single application, and whether the registration makes sense.

IANA must only accept registry updates from the Designated Experts and should direct all requests for registration to the review mailing list.

It is suggested that multiple Designated Experts be appointed who are able to represent the perspectives of different applications using this specification, in order to enable broadly-informed review of registration decisions. In cases where a registration decision could be perceived as creating a conflict of interest for a particular Expert, that Expert should defer to the judgment of the other Experts.

The reason for the use of the mailing list is to enable public review of registration requests, enabling both Designated Experts and other interested parties to provide feedback on proposed registrations. The reason to allow the Designated Experts to allocate values prior to publication as a final specification is to enable giving authors of specifications proposing registrations the benefit of review by the Designated Experts before the specification is completely done, so that if problems are identified, the authors can iterate and fix them before publication of the final specification.

## AuthZEN Policy Decision Point Metadata Registry

This specification establishes the IANA "AuthZEN Policy Decision Point Metadata" registry for AuthZEN policy decision point metadata names. The registry records the policy decision point metadata parameter and a reference to the specification that defines it.

### Registration Template

Metadata Name:
: The name requested (e.g., "resource"). This name is case-sensitive. Names may not match other registered names in a case-insensitive manner unless the Designated Experts state that there is a compelling reason to allow an exception.

Metadata Description:
: Brief description of the metadata (e.g., "Resource identifier URL").

Change Controller:
: For IETF stream RFCs, list the "IETF". For others, give the name of the responsible party. Other details (e.g., postal address, email address, home page URI) may also be included.

Specification Document(s):
: Reference to the document or documents that specify the parameter, preferably including URIs that can be used to retrieve copies of the documents. An indication of the relevant sections may also be included but is not required.

# Document History

[[ To be removed from the final specification ]]

* 00 - Initial version.
* 01 - Refactored the optional fields of Subject, Action, and Resource into a `properties` sub-object, making it easier to design meaningful JSON-schema and protobuf contracts for the API. Also changed the `evaluations` field from an object to an array, to preserve ordering semantics.
* 02 - Added the evaluations API.
