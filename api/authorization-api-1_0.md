--- abstract

The Authorization API enables Policy Decision Points (PDPs) and Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs) to communicate authorization requests and decisions to each other without requiring knowledge of each other's inner workings. The Authorization API is served by the PDP and is called by the PEP. The Authorization API includes evaluation endpoints, which provide specific access decisions, and search endpoints for discovering permissible subjects, resources, or actions.

--- middle

# Introduction
Computational services often implement access control within their components by separating Policy Decision Points (PDPs) from Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs). PDPs and PEPs are defined in XACML ({{XACML}}) and NIST's ABAC SP 800-162 ({{NIST.SP.800-162}}). Communication between PDPs and PEPs follows similar patterns across different software and services that require or provide authorization information. The Authorization API described in this document enables different providers to offer PDP and PEP capabilities without having to bind themselves to one particular implementation of a PDP or PEP.

# Model
The Authorization API is a transport-agnostic API published by the PDP, to which the PEP acts as a client. Possible bindings of this specification, such as HTTPS or gRPC, are described in Transport ({{transport}}).

Authentication for the Authorization API itself is out of scope for this document, since authentication for APIs is well-documented elsewhere. Support for OAuth 2.0 ({{RFC6749}}) is RECOMMENDED.

# Features
The core feature of the Authorization API is the Access Evaluation API, which enables a PEP to determine whether a specific request can be permitted to access a specific resource. The following are non-normative examples:

- Can Alice view document #123?
- Can Alice view document #123 at 16:30 on Tuesday, June 11, 2024?
- Can a manager print?

The Access Evaluations API enables execution of multiple evaluations in a single request. The following are non-normative examples:

- Can Alice view documents 123, 234 and 345 on Tuesday, June 11, 2024?
- Can document 123 be viewed by Alice and Bob?

The Search APIs provide lists of resources, subjects or actions that would be allowed access. The following are non-normative examples:

- Which documents can Alice view?
- Who can view document 123?
- What actions can Alice perform on document 123 on Tuesday, June 11, 2024?

# API Version
This document describes the API version 1.0. Any updates to this API through subsequent revisions of this document or other documents MAY augment this API, but MUST NOT modify the API described here. Augmentation MAY include additional API methods or additional parameters to existing API methods, additional authorization mechanisms, or additional optional headers in API requests. All API methods for version 1.0 MUST be immediately preceded by the relative URL path `/v1/`.

# Information Model {#information-model}
The information model for requests and responses include the following entities: Subject, Action, Resource, Context, and Decision. These are all defined below.

## Subject {#subject}
A Subject is the user or machine principal about whom the Authorization API is being invoked. The Subject may be requesting access at the time the Authorization API is invoked.

A Subject is a JSON object ({{Section 4 of RFC8259}}) that contains two REQUIRED keys, `type` and `id`, which have a `string` value, and an OPTIONAL key, `properties`, with a value of a JSON object.

`type`:
: REQUIRED. A `string` value that specifies the type of the Subject.

`id`:
: REQUIRED. A `string` value containing the unique identifier of the Subject, scoped to the `type`.

`properties`:
: OPTIONAL. A JSON object which can be used to express additional attributes of a Subject.


### Subject Properties {#subject-properties}
Many authorization systems are stateless, and expect the client (PEP) to pass in all relevant attributes used in the evaluation of the authorization policy. To satisfy this requirement, Subjects MAY include additional attributes as key-value pairs, under the `properties` object. A property can contain any JSON value as described in {{Section 3 of RFC8259}}).

Examples of subject attributes can include, but are not limited to:

- department,
- group memberships,
- device identifier,
- IP address.

### Examples (non-normative) {#subject-examples}

The following is a non-normative example of a minimal Subject:

~~~ json
{
  "type": "user",
  "id": "alice@example.com"
}
~~~
{: #subject-example title="Example Subject"}

The following is a non-normative example of a Subject which adds a string-valued `department` property:

~~~ json
{
  "type": "user",
  "id": "alice@example.com",
  "properties": {
    "department": "Sales"
  }
}
~~~
{: #subject-department-example title="Example Subject with Additional Property"}

The following is a non-normative example of a subject which adds IP address and device identifier properties:

~~~ json
{
  "type": "user",
  "id": "alice@example.com",
  "properties": {
    "ip_address": "172.217.22.14",
    "device_id": "8:65:ee:17:7e:0b"
  }
}
~~~
{: #subject-device-id-example title="Example Subject with IP Address and Device ID"}

## Resource {#resource}
A Resource is the target of an access request. It is a JSON object ({{Section 4 of RFC8259}}) that is constructed similar to a Subject entity. It has the following keys:

`type`:
: REQUIRED. A `string` value that specifies the type of the Resource.

`id`:
: REQUIRED. A `string` value containing the unique identifier of the Resource, scoped to the `type`.

`properties`:
: OPTIONAL. A JSON object which can be used to express additional attributes of a Resource.

### Resource Properties {#resource-properties}

Similarly to the Subject properties, the PEP can also provide attributes for the Resource in the properties field.

Such attributes can include, but are not limited to, attributes of the resource used in access evaluations or metadata about the resource.

### Examples (non-normative) {#resource-examples}

The following is a non-normative example of a Resource with a `type` and a simple `id`:

~~~ json
{
  "type": "book",
  "id": "123"
}
~~~
{: #resource-example title="Example Resource"}

The following is a non-normative example of a Resource containing a `library_record` property, that is itself a JSON object:

~~~ json
{
  "type": "book",
  "id": "123",
  "properties": {
    "library_record":{
      "title": "AuthZEN in Action",
      "isbn": "978-0593383322"
    }
  }
}
~~~
{: #resource-example-structured title="Example Resource with Additional Property"}

## Action {#action}
An Action is the type of access that the requester intends to perform.

Action is a JSON object ({{Section 4 of RFC8259}}) that contains a REQUIRED `name` key with a `string` value, and an OPTIONAL `properties` key with a JSON object value.

`name`:
: REQUIRED. The name of the Action.

`properties`:
: OPTIONAL. A JSON object which can be used to express additional attributes of an Action.

### Action Properties {#action-properties}

Similarly to the Subject and Resource properties, the PEP can also provide attributes for the Action in the properties field.

Such attributes can include, but are not limited to, parameters of the action that is being requested.

### Examples (non-normative) {#action-examples}

The following is a non-normative example of an action:

~~~ json
{
  "name": "can_read"
}
~~~
{: #action-example title="Example Action"}

The following is a non-normative example of an action with additional properties:

~~~ json
{
  "name": "extend-loan",
  "properties": {
    "period": "2W"
  }
}
~~~
{: #action-extend-loan-example title="Example Action with properties for extending a book loan."}

## Context {#context}
The Context represents the environment of the access evaluation request.

Context is a JSON object ({{Section 4 of RFC8259}}) which can be used to express attributes of the environment. 

Examples of context attributes can include, but are not limited to:

- The time of day,
- Location from which the request was received,
- Capabilities of the PEP,
- JSON Schema or JSON-LD definitions for the request.

### Examples (non-normative) {#context-examples}

The following is a non-normative example of a Context:

~~~ json
{
  "time": "1985-10-26T01:22-07:00"
}
~~~
{: #context-example title="Example Context"}


The following example of a Context provides a JSON Schema definition which can be used to parse and validate the AuthZEN request:

~~~ json
{
  "time": "1985-10-26T01:22-07:00",
  "schema": "https://schema.example.com/access-request.schema.json"
}
~~~
{: #context-schema-example title="Example Context with a reference to a JSON schema"}


## Decision {#decision}
A Decision is the result of the evaluation of an access request. It provides the information required for the PEP to enforce the decision.

Decision is a JSON object ({{Section 4 of RFC8259}}) that contains a REQUIRED `decision` key with a `boolean` value, and an OPTIONAL `context` key with a JSON object value.

`decision`:
: REQUIRED. A boolean value that specifies whether the Decision is to allow or deny the operation.

`context`:
: OPTIONAL. A JSON object which can convey additional information that can be used by the PEP as part of the decision enforcement process.

In this specification, assuming the evaluation was successful, there are only two possible values for the `decision`:

- `true`: The access request is permitted to go forward. If the PEP does not understand information in the `context` response object, the PEP MAY choose to reject the decision.
- `false`: The access request is denied and MUST NOT be permitted to go forward.

The following is a non-normative example of a minimal Decision:

~~~ json
{
  "decision": true
}
~~~
{: #decision-example title="Example Decision"}

### Decision Context {#decision-context}
In addition to a `decision`, a response MAY contain a `context` field which can be any JSON object. This context can convey additional information that can be used by the PEP as part of the decision enforcement process.

Examples include, but are not limited to:

- Reason(s) a decision was made,
- "Advices" and/or "Obligations" tied to the access decision,
- Hints for rendering UI state,
- Instructions for step-up authentication,
- Environmental information,
- etc.

### Examples (non-normative) {#decision-examples}
The following are all non-normative examples of possible and valid contexts, provided to illustrate possible usages. The actual semantics and format of the `context` object are an implementation concern and outside the scope of this specification. For example, implementations MAY use keys that correspond to concepts from other standards, such as HTTP status codes, to convey common reasons in an interoperable manner.

#### Non-normative Example 1: conveying decision Reasons
The PDP may provide reasons to explain a decision. In the non-normative example below, an implementation might convey different reasons to administrators and end-users, using keys that could correspond to HTTP status codes:

~~~ json
{
  "decision": false,
  "context": {
    "reason_admin": {
      "403": "Request failed policy C076E82F"
    },
    "reason_user": {
      "403": "Insufficient privileges. Contact your administrator"
    }
  }
}
~~~
{: #response-with-reason-context-example title="Non-normative Example Response with reason Context"}

#### Non-normative Example 2: conveying metadata and environmental elements
In the following non-normative example, the PDP justifies its decision by including environmental conditions that did not meet its policies. Metadata pertaining to the decision response times is also provided:

~~~ json
{
  "decision": false,
  "context": {
    "metadata": {
      "response-time": 60,
      "response-time-unit": "ms"
    },
    "environment": {
      "ip": "10.10.0.1",
      "datetime": "2025-06-27T18:03:07Z",
      "os": "ubuntu24.04.2LTS-AMDx64"
    }
  }
}
~~~
{: #response-with-environment-context-example title="Non-normative Example Response with Environment and Metadata Context"}

#### Non-normative Example 3: requesting step-up authentication
In the following non-normative example, the PDP requests a step-up authentication of the requesting subject, by signalling the required `acr` and `amr` access token claim values it expects to see in order to approve the request:

~~~ json
{
  "decision": false,
  "context": {
    "acr_values": "urn:com:example:loa:3",
    "amr_values": "mfa hwk"
  }
}
~~~
{: #response-with-step-up-example title="Non-normative Example Response with a step-up request Context"}

# Access Evaluation API {#access-evaluation-api}

The Access Evaluation API defines the message exchange pattern between a client (PEP) and an authorization service (PDP) for executing a single access evaluation.

## The Access Evaluation API Request {#access-evaluation-request}
The Access Evaluation request is an object consisting of four entities previously defined in the Information Model ({{information-model}}):

`subject`:
: REQUIRED. The subject (or principal) of type Subject

`action`:
: REQUIRED. The action (or verb) of type Action.

`resource`:
: REQUIRED. The resource of type Resource.

`context`:
: OPTIONAL. The context (or environment) of type Context.

### Example (non-normative)

~~~ json
{
  "subject": {
    "type": "user",
    "id": "alice@example.com"
  },
  "resource": {
    "type": "account",
    "id": "123"
  },
  "action": {
    "name": "can_read",
    "properties": {
      "method": "GET"
    }
  },
  "context": {
    "time": "1985-10-26T01:22-07:00"
  }
}
~~~
{: #request-example title="Example Request"}

## The Access Evaluation API Response {#access-evaluation-response}

The response of the Access Evaluation API consists of the Decision entity as defined in the Information Model ({{information-model}}).

# Access Evaluations API {#access-evaluations-api}

The Access Evaluations API defines the message exchange pattern between a client (PEP) and an authorization service (PDP) for evaluating multiple access evaluations within the scope of a single message exchange (also known as "boxcarring" requests).

## The Access Evaluations API Request {#access-evaluations-request}

The Access Evaluation API Request builds on the information model presented in {{information-model}} and the object defined in the Access Evaluation Request ({{access-evaluation-request}}).

To send multiple access evaluation requests in a single message, the caller MAY add an `evaluations` key to the request. The `evaluations` key is an array which contains a list of JSON objects, each typed as the object as defined in the Access Evaluation Request ({{access-evaluation-request}}), and specifying a discrete request.

If an `evaluations` array is NOT present or is empty, the Access Evaluations Request behaves in a backwards-compatible manner with the (single) Access Evaluation API Request ({{access-evaluation-request}}).

If an `evaluations` array IS present and contains one or more objects, these form distinct requests that the PDP will evaluate. These requests are independent from each other, and may be executed sequentially or in parallel, left to the discretion of each implementation.

The top-level `subject`, `action`, `resource`, and `context` keys provide default values for their respective fields in the `evaluations` array.  The top-level `subject`, `action` and `resource` keys MAY be omitted if the `evaluations` array is present, contains one or more objects, and every object in the `evaluations` array contains the respective top-level key. This behavior is described in {{default-values}}.

The following is a non-normative example for specifying three requests, with no default values:

~~~json
{
  "evaluations": [
    {
      "subject": {
        "type": "user",
        "id": "alice@example.com"
      },
      "action": {
        "name": "can_read"
      },
      "resource": {
        "type": "document",
        "id": "boxcarring.md"
      },
      "context": {
        "time": "2024-05-31T15:22-07:00"
      }
    },
    {
      "subject": {
        "type": "user",
        "id": "alice@example.com"
      },
      "action": {
        "name": "can_read"
      },
      "resource": {
        "type": "document",
        "id": "subject-search.md"
      },
      "context": {
        "time": "2024-05-31T15:22-07:00"
      }
    },
    {
      "subject": {
        "type": "user",
        "id": "alice@example.com"
      },
      "action": {
        "name": "can_read"
      },
      "resource": {
        "type": "document",
        "id": "resource-search.md"
      },
      "context": {
        "time": "2024-05-31T15:22-07:00"
      }
    }
  ]
}
~~~

### Default values {#default-values}

While the example above provides the most flexibility in specifying distinct values in each request for every evaluation, it is common for boxcarred requests to share one or more values of the evaluation request. For example, evaluations MAY all refer to a single subject, and/or have the same contextual (environmental) attributes.

Default values offer a more compact syntax that avoids over-duplication of request data.

The top-level `subject`, `action`, `resource`, and `context` keys provide default values for each object in the evaluations array. Any of these keys specified within an individual evaluation object overrides the corresponding top-level default. Because `subject`, `action`, and `resource` are required for a valid evaluation, any of these keys omitted from an evaluation object MUST be provided as a top-level key.

The following is a non-normative example for specifying three requests that refer to a single subject and context:

~~~json
{
  "subject": {
    "type": "user",
    "id": "alice@example.com"
  },
  "context": {
    "time": "2024-05-31T15:22-07:00"
  },
  "evaluations": [
    {
      "action": {
        "name": "can_read"
      },
      "resource": {
        "type": "document",
        "id": "boxcarring.md"
      }
    },
    {
      "action": {
        "name": "can_read"
      },
      "resource": {
        "type": "document",
        "id": "subject-search.md"
      }
    },
    {
      "action": {
        "name": "can_read"
      },
      "resource": {
        "type": "document",
        "id": "resource-search.md"
      }
    }
  ]
}
~~~

The following is a non-normative example for specifying three requests that refer to a single `subject` and `context`, with a default value for `action`, that is overridden by the third request:

~~~json
{
  "subject": {
    "type": "user",
    "id": "alice@example.com"
  },
  "context": {
    "time": "2024-05-31T15:22-07:00"
  },
  "action": {
    "name": "can_read"
  },
  "evaluations": [
    {
      "resource": {
        "type": "document",
        "id": "boxcarring.md"
      }
    },
    {
      "resource": {
        "type": "document",
        "id": "subject-search.md"
      }
    },
    {
      "action": {
        "name": "can_edit"
      },
      "resource": {
        "type": "document",
        "id": "resource-search.md"
      }
    }
  ]
}
~~~

### Evaluations options

The `evaluations` request payload includes an OPTIONAL `options` key, with a value that is a JSON object.

This provides a general-purpose mechanism for providing caller-supplied metadata on how the request is to be executed.

One such option controls *evaluation semantics*, and is described in {{evaluations-semantics}}.

A non-normative example of the `options` field is shown below, following an `evaluations` array provided for the sake of completeness:

~~~json
{
  "evaluations": [{
    "resource": {
      "type": "doc",
      "id": "1"
    },
    "subject": {
      "type": "doc",
      "id": "2"
    }
  }],
  "options": {
    "evaluations_semantic": "execute_all",
    "another_option": "value"
  }
}
~~~

#### Evaluations semantics {#evaluations-semantics}

By default, every request in the `evaluations` array is executed and a response returned in the same array order. This is the most common use-case for boxcarring multiple evaluation requests in a single payload.

This specification supports three evaluation semantics:

1. *Execute all requests (potentially in parallel), return all results.* Any failure can be denoted by `"decision": false` and MAY provide a reason code in the context.
2. *Deny on first denial (or failure).* This semantic could be desired if a PEP wants to issue a few requests in a particular order, with any denial (error, or `"decision": false`) "short-circuiting" the evaluations call and returning on the first denial. This essentially works like the `&&` operator in programming languages.
3. *Permit on first permit.* This is the converse "short-circuiting" semantic, working like the `||` operator in programming languages.

To select the desired evaluation semantic, a caller can pass in `options.evaluations_semantic` with exactly one of the following values:

  * `execute_all`
  * `deny_on_first_deny`
  * `permit_on_first_permit`

`execute_all` is the default semantic, so an `evaluations` request without the `options.evaluations_semantic` flag will execute using this semantic.

##### Example: Evaluate `read` action for three documents using all three semantics

Execute all requests:

~~~json
{
  "subject": {
    "type": "user",
    "id": "alice@example.com"
  },
  "action": {
    "name": "read"
  },
  "options": {
    "evaluations_semantic": "execute_all"
  },
  "evaluations": [
    {
      "resource": {
        "type": "document",
        "id": "1"
      }
    },
    {
      "resource": {
        "type": "document",
        "id": "2"
      }
    },
    {
      "resource": {
        "type": "document",
        "id": "3"
      }
    }
  ]
}
~~~

Response:

~~~json
{
  "evaluations": [
    {
      "decision": true
    },
    {
      "decision": false
    },
    {
      "decision": true
    }
  ]
}
~~~

Deny on first deny:

~~~json
{
  "subject": {
    "type": "user",
    "id": "alice@example.com"
  },
  "action": {
    "name": "read"
  },
  "options": {
    "evaluations_semantic": "deny_on_first_deny"
  },
  "evaluations": [
    {
      "resource": {
        "type": "document",
        "id": "1"
      }
    },
    {
      "resource": {
        "type": "document",
        "id": "2"
      }
    },
    {
      "resource": {
        "type": "document",
        "id": "3"
      }
    }
  ]
}
~~~

Response:

~~~json
{
  "evaluations": [
    {
      "decision": true
    },
    {

## Access Evaluations API Response {#access-evaluations-response}

Like the request format, the Access Evaluations Response format for an Access Evaluations Request adds an `evaluations` array that lists the decisions in the same order they were provided in the `evaluations` array in the request. Each value of the evaluations array is typed as a Decision as defined in the Information Model ({{information-model}}).

In case the `evaluations` array is present, it is RECOMMENDED that the `decision` key of the response be omitted. If present, it can be ignored by the caller.

The following is a non-normative example of a Access Evaluations Response to an Access Evaluations Request containing three evaluation objects:

~~~json
{
  "evaluations": [
    {
      "decision": true
    },
    {
      "decision": false,
      "context": {
        "reason": "resource not found"
      }
    },
    {
      "decision": false,
      "context": {
        "reason": "Subject is a viewer of the resource"
      }
    }
  ]
}
~~~

### Errors

There are two types of errors, and they are handled differently:
1. Transport-level errors, or errors that pertain to the entire payload.
2. Errors in individual evaluations.

The first type of error is handled at the transport level. For example, for the HTTP binding, the 4XX and 5XX codes indicate a general error that pertains to the entire payload, as described in Transport ({{transport}}).

The second type of error is handled at the payload level. Decisions default to *closed* (i.e. `false`), but the `context` field can include errors that are specific to that request.

The following is a non-normative example of a response to an Access Evaluations Request containing three evaluation objects, two of them demonstrating how errors can be returned for two of the evaluation requests:

~~~json
{
  "evaluations": [
    {
      "decision": true
    },
    {
      "decision": false,
      "context": {
        "error": {
          "status": 404,
          "message": "Resource not found"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "decision": false,
      "context": {
        "reason": "Subject is a viewer of the resource"
      }
    }
  ]
}
~~~


# Search APIs {#search}

The Search APIs define the message exchange pattern between a client (PEP) and an authorization service (PDP) for returning a set of subjects, resources, or actions that match specified search criteria.

## Search Semantics {#search-semantics}

While the evaluation of a search is implementation-specific, it is expected that any returned result that is then used in an Access Evaluation API call MUST result in a `"decision": true` response.

In addition, it is RECOMMENDED that a search be performed transitively, traversing intermediate attributes and/or relationships. For example, if user U is a member of group G, and group G is designated as a viewer on a document D, then a search for all subjects that can view document D will include user U.

## Search Pagination {#search-pagination}

The set of results returned by Search APIs can be very large. Search APIs use `page` objects in requests and responses to navigate and return subsets of the larger result set.

To facilitate this, an `offset` value is used that indicates a specific starting point within the result set. The `offset` value may also contain non-numeric values such as cursors or tokens.

Paginated search responses include a `next_offset` value. This allows clients to paginate across a result set without needing to know the mechanism for determining the next offset.

Clients of the Search APIs can paginate across a result set by:
- issuing an initial request without an `offset` value,
- repeatedly passing the `next_offset` value from a response as the `offset` value of the next request,
- until no `next_offset` value is provided.

This pagination model does not guarantee an atomic snapshot of the result set. Consequently, if items are added or removed while paginating, clients SHOULD be prepared that results can be repeated or omitted between pages.

If a search request omits the `page` object, omits the `offset` key, or if the `offset` value is null, then the first page of the result set MUST be returned.

If a search response does not contain all remaining results from a given `offset`, it MUST contain a `page` object with a non-empty `next_offset` value that can be used in a subsequent request to retrieve the next page of search results. 

If a search response contains all remaining results from a given `offset` and includes a `page` object, that `page` object MUST NOT contain a non-null `next_offset` value.

## Search API Request {#search-request}

A search request is constructed based on the Subject, Resource, Action and Context entities defined in the Information Model ({{information-model}}). For a search request, the unique identifier of the entity being searched for is omitted. Additionally, a `page` object, as defined in {{search-request-pagination}}, MAY be provided.

The following is a non-normative example of a request to retrieve the resources that user `alice@example.com` can read:

~~~ json
{
  "subject": {
    "type": "user",
    "id": "alice@example.com"
  },
  "action": {
    "name": "can_read"
  },
  "resource": {
    "type": "account"
  }
}
~~~
{: #search-request-example title="Example Search Request"}

### Search Request Pagination {#search-request-pagination}

A search request MAY include a `page` object to control pagination. This object can contain the following keys:

`offset`: 
: OPTIONAL. A value specifying an offset in the result set, as described in {{search-pagination}}. 

`limit`: 
: OPTIONAL. An integer indicating a desired maximum number of results for the server to return. The server MAY implement this feature but is not required to do so and MAY ignore the value.

The following is a non-normative example of a request to retrieve a subsequent page of a result set with a desired limit of 20 results:

~~~ json
{
  "subject": {
    "type": "user",
    "id": "alice@example.com"
  },
  "action": {
    "name": "can_read"
  },
  "resource": {
    "type": "account"
  },
  "page": {
    "offset": 80,
    "limit": 20
  }
}
~~~
{: #search-request-pagination-example title="Example Search Request with pagination"}


## Search API Response {#search-response}

The response to a search request is a JSON object with the following keys:

`page`:
: OPTIONAL. An object providing pagination information, as defined in {{search-response-pagination}}. It is RECOMMENDED that the page object be the first key in the response. This allows clients to provide progress indicators while processing large response bodies.

`results`:
: REQUIRED. An array containing zero or more entities, as defined in the Information Model ({{information-model}}). It MUST contain only entities of the type being searched for (e.g., Subjects, Resources, or Actions).

`context`:
: OPTIONAL. An object that can convey additional information that can be used by the PEP, similar to its function in the Access Evaluation Response.

The following is a non-normative example of a search response using a non-numeric offset:

~~~ json
{
  "context": {
    "query_execution_time_ms": 42
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "type": "account",
      "id": "123"
    },
    {
      "type": "account",
      "id": "456"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
~~~
{: #search-response-example title="Example Search Response"}


### Search Response Pagination {#search-response-pagination}

A search response MAY contain a `page` object that provides pagination information with the following keys:

`next_offset`: 
: OPTIONAL. A value that can be used to retrieve the next page of the result set, as described in {{search-pagination}}. 

`count`: 
: OPTIONAL. An integer representing the number of results included in the current response.

`total`:
: OPTIONAL. An integer representing the total number of results available for the complete result set, across all pages.

The following is a non-normative example of a search response using a non-numeric offset:

~~~ json
{
  "page": {
    "next_offset": "alsehrq3495u8",
    "count": 20,
    "total": 105
  },

      "id": "456"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
~~~

## Subject Search API {#subject-search-api}

The Subject Search API returns all subjects that match the search criteria. It is based on the Access Evaluation information model but omits the identifier of the Subject from the request.

### The Subject Search API Request {#subject-search-request}

The Subject Search request is an object consisting of the following entities:

`subject`:
: REQUIRED. The subject (or principal) of type Subject. This object MUST contain a `type` key, but its `id` key SHOULD be omitted. If present, the `id` key and its value MUST be ignored.

# Policy Decision Point Metadata {#pdp-metadata}

Policy Decision Points can have metadata describing their configuration. 

## Data structure {#pdp-metadata-data}

The following Policy Decision Point metadata parameters are used by this specification and are registered in the IANA "AuthZEN PDP Metadata" registry established in {{iana-pdp-registry}}.

### Endpoint Parameters {#pdp-metadata-data-endpoint}

`policy_decision_point`:
: REQUIRED. The Policy Decision Point's identifier, which is a URL that uses the "https" scheme and has no query or fragment components. Policy Decision Point metadata is published at a location that is ".well-known" according to {{RFC5785}} derived from this Policy Decision Point identifier, as described in {{pdp-metadata-access}}. The Policy Decision Point identifier is used to prevent Policy Decision Point mix-up attacks.

`access_evaluation_endpoint`:
: REQUIRED. URL of Policy Decision Point Access Evaluation API endpoint

`access_evaluations_endpoint`:
: OPTIONAL. URL of Policy Decision Point Access Evaluations API endpoint

`search_subject_endpoint`:
: OPTIONAL. URL of Policy Decision Point Search API endpoint for subject element

`search_action_endpoint`:
: OPTIONAL. URL of Policy Decision Point Search API endpoint for action element

`search_resource_endpoint`:
: OPTIONAL. URL of Policy Decision Point Search API endpoint for resource element

`capabilities`:
: OPTIONAL. JSON array containing a list of registered IANA URNs referencing PDP specific capabilities.

Note: the absence of any of these parameters is sufficient for the Policy Enforcement Point to determine that the Policy Decision Point is not capable and therefore will not return a result for the associated API.

### Signature Parameter {#pdp-metadata-data-sig}

In addition to JSON elements, metadata values MAY also be provided as a `signed_metadata` value, which is a JSON Web Token {{RFC7519}} that asserts metadata values about the Policy Decision Point as a bundle. A set of metadata parameters that can be used in signed metadata as claims are defined in {{pdp-metadata-data-endpoint}}. The signed metadata MUST be digitally signed or MACed using JSON Web Signature {{RFC7515}} and MUST contain an `iss` (issuer) claim denoting the party attesting to the claims in the signed metadata.

Consumers of the metadata MAY ignore the signed metadata if they do not support this feature. If the consumer of the metadata supports signed metadata, metadata values conveyed in the signed metadata MUST take precedence over the corresponding values conveyed using plain JSON elements. Signed metadata is included in the Policy Decision Point metadata JSON object using this OPTIONAL metadata parameter:

`signed_metadata`:
: A JWT containing metadata parameters about the protected resource as claims. This is a string value consisting of the entire signed JWT. A `signed_metadata` parameter SHOULD NOT appear as a claim in the JWT; it is RECOMMENDED to reject any metadata in which this occurs.

## Obtaining Policy Decision Point Metadata {#pdp-metadata-access}

Policy Decision Points supporting metadata MUST make a JSON document containing metadata as specified in {{pdp-metadata-data-endpoint}} available at a URL formed by inserting a well-known URI string between the host component and the path and/or query components, if any. The well-known URI string used is `/.well-known/authzen-configuration`.

The syntax and semantics of .well-known are defined in {{RFC8615}}. The well-known URI path suffix used is registered in the IANA "Well-Known URIs" registry {{IANA.well-known-uris}}.

### Policy Decision Point Metadata Request {#pdp-metadata-access-request}

A Policy Decision Point metadata document MUST be queried using an HTTP GET request at the previously specified URL. The consumer of the metadata would make the following request when the resource identifier is https://pdp.example.com:

~~~ http
GET /.well-known/authzen-configuration HTTP/1.1
Host: pdp.example.com
~~~

### Policy Decision Point Metadata Response {#pdp-metadata-access-response}

The response is a set of metadata parameters about the protected resource's configuration. A successful response MUST use the `200 OK HTTP` status code and return a JSON object using the `application/json` content type that contains a set of metadata parameters as its members that are a subset of the metadata parameters defined in {{pdp-metadata-data-endpoint}}. Additional metadata parameters MAY be defined and used; any metadata parameters that are not understood MUST be ignored.

Parameters with multiple values are represented as JSON arrays. Parameters with zero values MUST be omitted from the response.

An error response uses the applicable HTTP status code value.

The following is a non-normative example response:

~~~ http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "policy_decision_point": "https://pdp.example.com",
  "access_evaluation_endpoint": "https://pdp.example.com/access/v1/evaluation",
  "search_subject_endpoint": "https://pdp.example.com/access/v1/search/subject",
  "search_resource_endpoint": "https://pdp.example.com/access/v1/search/resource"
}
~~~

### Policy Decision Point Metadata Validation {#pdp-metadata-data-endpoint-validation}

The `policy_decision_point` value returned MUST be identical to the Policy Decision Point identifier value into which the well-known URI string was inserted to create the URL used to retrieve the metadata.  If these values are not identical, the data contained in the response MUST NOT be used.

The recipient MUST validate that any signed metadata was signed by a key belonging to the issuer and that the signature is valid. If the signature does not validate or the issuer is not trusted, the recipient SHOULD treat this as an error condition.

# Transport

This specification defines an HTTPS binding which MUST be implemented by a compliant PDP.

Additional transport bindings (e.g. gRPC) MAY be defined in the future in the form of profiles, and MAY be implemented by a PDP.

## HTTPS Binding

### HTTPS Access Evaluation Request
The Access Evaluation Request is made via an HTTPS POST request. The request MUST include a `Content-Type` header with the value `application/json`. The request body MUST be a JSON object that conforms to the Access Evaluation Request structure, as defined in {{access-evaluation-request}}.

The request URL MUST be the value of the `access_evaluation_endpoint` parameter if it is provided in the PDP Metadata ({{pdp-metadata-data-endpoint}}). If the parameter is not provided, the URL SHOULD be formed by appending the relative path `/access/v1/evaluation` to the Policy Decision Point's base URL (which is the `policy_decision_point` value from the PDP Metadata, if available).

The following is a non-normative example of the HTTPS binding of the Access Evaluation Request:

### HTTPS Resource Search Response
The success response to a Resource Search Request is an HTTPS response with a `status` code of `200`, and `content-type` of `application/json`. Its body is a JSON object that contains the Search Response, as defined in {{search-response}} containing Resource entities as its `results`.

The following is a non-normative example of an HTTPS Resource Search Response:

~~~ http
HTTP/1.1 OK
Content-Type: application/json
X-Request-ID: bfe9eb29-ab87-4ca3-be83-a1d5d8305716

{
  "results": [
    {
      "type": "account",
      "id": "123"
    },
    {
      "type": "account",
      "id": "456"
    }
  ],
  "page": {
    "next_offset": 80
  }
}
~~~
{: #example-resource-search-response title="Example of an HTTPS Resource Search Response"}

### HTTPS Action Search Request
The Action Search Request is made via an HTTPS POST request. The request MUST include a `Content-Type` header with the value `application/json`. The request body MUST be a JSON object that conforms to the Action Search Request structure, as defined in {{action-search-request}}.

The request URL MUST be the value of the `search_action_endpoint` parameter if it is provided in the PDP Metadata ({{pdp-metadata-data-endpoint}}). If the parameter is not provided, the URL SHOULD be formed by appending the relative path `/access/v1/search/action` to the Policy Decision Point's base URL (which is the `policy_decision_point` value from the PDP Metadata, if available).

The following is a non-normative example of the HTTPS binding of the Action Search Request:

~~~ http
POST /access/v1/search/action HTTP/1.1
Host: pdp.example.com
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <myoauthtoken>
X-Request-ID: bfe9eb29-ab87-4ca3-be83-a1d5d8305716

{
  "subject": {
    "type": "user",
    "id": "alice@example.com"
  },
  "resource": {
    "type": "account",
    "id": "123"
  },
  "context": {
    "time": "2024-10-26T01:22-07:00"
  }
}
~~~
{: #example-action-search-request title="Example of an HTTPS Action Search Request"}

### HTTPS Action Search Response
The success response to an Action Search Request is an HTTPS response with a `status` code of `200`, and `content-type` of `application/json`. Its body is a JSON object that contains the Search Response, as defined in {{search-response}} containing Action entities as its `results`.

The following is a non-normative example of an HTTPS Action Search Response:

~~~ http
HTTP/1.1 OK
Content-Type: application/json
X-Request-ID: bfe9eb29-ab87-4ca3-be83-a1d5d8305716

{
  "results": [
    {
      "name": "can_read"
    },
    {
      "name": "can_write"
    }
  ],
  "page": {
    "next_offset": 80
  }
}
~~~
{: #example-action-search-response title="Example of an HTTPS Action Search Response"}

### Error Responses
The following error responses are common to all methods of the Authorization API. The error response is indicated by an HTTPS status code ({{Section 15 of RFC9110}}) that indicates error.

The following errors are indicated by the status codes defined below:

| Code | Description  | HTTPS Body Content |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| 400  | Bad Request  | An error message string |
| 401  | Unauthorized | An error message string |
| 403  | Forbidden    | An error message string |
| 500  | Internal Error | An error message string |
{: #table-error-status-codes title="HTTPS Error status codes"}

Note: HTTPS errors are returned by the PDP to indicate an error condition relating to the request or its processing; they are unrelated to the outcome of an authorization decision and are distinct from it. A successful request that results in a "deny" is indicated by a 200 OK status code with a { "decision": false } payload.

To make this concrete:

- a `401` HTTPS status code indicates that the caller (Policy Enforcement Point) did not properly authenticate to the PDP - for example, by omitting a required `Authorization` header, or using an invalid access token.
- the PDP indicates to the caller that the authorization request is denied by sending a response with a `200` HTTPS status code, along with a payload of `{ "decision": false }`.

### Request Identification
All requests to the API MAY have request identifiers to uniquely identify them. The API client (PEP) is responsible for generating the request identifier. If present, it is RECOMMENDED to use the HTTPS Header `X-Request-ID` as the request identifier. The value of this header is an arbitrary string. The following non-normative example describes this header:

~~~ http
POST /access/v1/evaluation HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM
X-Request-ID: bfe9eb29-ab87-4ca3-be83-a1d5d8305716
~~~
{: #request-id-example title="Example HTTPS request with a Request Id Header"}

### Request Identification in a Response
When an Authorization API request contains a request identifier the PDP MUST include a request identifier in the response. It is RECOMMENDED to specify the request identifier using the HTTPS Response header `X-Request-ID`. If the PEP specified a request identifier in the request, the PDP MUST include the same identifier in the response to that request.

The following is a non-normative example of an HTTPS Response with this header:

~~~ http
HTTP/1.1 OK
Content-Type: application/json
X-Request-ID: bfe9eb29-ab87-4ca3-be83-a1d5d8305716
~~~
{: #example-response-request-id title="Example HTTPS response with a Request Id Header"}

# Security Considerations {#Security}

## Communication Integrity and Confidentiality {#security-integrity-confidentiality}

In the ABAC architecture, the PEP-PDP connection is the most sensitive one and needs to be secured to guarantee:

 - Integrity
 - Confidentiality

As a result, the connection between the PEP and the PDP MUST be secured using the most adequate means given the choice of transport (e.g. TLS for HTTP REST).

## Policy Confidentiality and Sender Authentication {#security-confidentiality-authn}

Additionally, the PDP SHOULD authenticate the calling PEP. There are several ways authentication can be established. These ways are out of scope of this specification. They MAY include:

 - Mutual TLS
 - OAuth-based authentication
 - API key

The choice and strength of either mechanism is not in scope.

Authenticating the PEP allows the PDP to avoid common attacks (such as DoS - see below) and/or reveal its internal policies. A malicious actor could craft a large number of requests to try and understand what policies the PDP is configured with. Requesting a client (PEP) be authenticated mitigates that risk.

## Sender Authentication Failure {#security-sender-authentn-fail}

If the protected resource request does not include the proper authentication credentials, or does not have a valid authentication scheme proof that enables access to the protected resource, the resource server MUST respond with a 401 HTTP status code and SHOULD include the HTTP "WWW-Authenticate" response header field; it MAY include it in response to other conditions as well. The "WWW-Authenticate" header field uses the framework defined by HTTP/1.1 {{RFC2617}} and indicates the expected authentication scheme as well as the realm that has authority for it.

The following is a non-normative example response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="https://as.example.com"
```

## Trust {#security-trust}

In ABAC, there are occasionally conversations around the trust between PEP and PDP: how can the PDP trust that the PEP is sending the correct values? The architecture of this model assumes the PDP must trust the PEP, as the PEP is ultimately responsible for enforcing the decision the PDP produces. 

## Availability & Denial of Service {#security-avail-dos}}

The PDP SHOULD apply reasonable protections to avoid common attacks tied to request payload size, the number of requests, invalid JSON, nested JSON attacks, or memory consumption. Rate limiting is one such way to address such issues.

## Differences between Unsigned and Signed Metadata {#security-metadata-sig}

Unsigned metadata is integrity protected by use of TLS at the site where it is hosted. This means that its security is dependent upon the Internet Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) {{RFC9525}}. Signed metadata is additionally integrity protected by the JWS signature applied by the issuer, which is not dependent upon the Internet PKI.
When using unsigned metadata, the party issuing the metadata is the Policy Decision Point itself. Whereas, when using signed metadata, the party issuing the metadata is represented by the `iss` (issuer) claim in the signed metadata. When using signed metadata, applications can make trust decisions based on the issuer that performed the signing -- information that is not available when using unsigned metadata. How these trust decisions are made is out of scope for this specification.

## Metadata Caching {#security-metadata-caching}

Policy decision point metadata is retrieved using an HTTP GET request, as specified in {{pdp-metadata-access-request}}. Normal HTTP caching behaviors apply, meaning that the GET may retrieve a cached copy of the content, rather than the latest copy. Implementations should utilize HTTP caching directives such as Cache-Control with max-age, as defined in {{RFC7234}}, to enable caching of retrieved metadata for appropriate time periods.

# IANA Considerations {#iana}

The following registration procedure is used for the registry established by this specification.

Values are registered on a Specification Required {{RFC8126}} basis after a two-week review period on the openid-specs-authzen@lists.openid.net mailing list, on the advice of one or more Designated Experts. However, to allow for the allocation of values prior to publication of the final version of a specification, the Designated Experts may approve registration once they are satisfied that the specification will be completed and published. However, if the specification is not completed and published in a timely manner, as determined by the Designated Experts, the Designated Experts may request that IANA withdraw the registration.

Registration requests sent to the mailing list for review should use an appropriate subject (e.g., "Request to register AuthZEN Policy Decision Point Metadata: example").

Within the review period, the Designated Experts will either approve or deny the registration request, communicating this decision to the review list and IANA. Denials should include an explanation and, if applicable, suggestions as to how to make the request successful. The IANA escalation process is followed when the Designated Experts are not responsive within 14 days.

Criteria that should be applied by the Designated Experts includes determining whether the proposed registration duplicates existing functionality, determining whether it is likely to be of general applicability or whether it is useful only for a single application, and whether the registration makes sense.

IANA must only accept registry updates from the Designated Experts and should direct all requests for registration to the review mailing list.

It is suggested that multiple Designated Experts be appointed who are able to represent the perspectives of different applications using this specification, in order to enable broadly-informed review of registration decisions. In cases where a registration decision could be perceived as creating a conflict of interest for a particular Expert, that Expert should defer to the judgment of the other Experts.

The reason for the use of the mailing list is to enable public review of registration requests, enabling both Designated Experts and other interested parties to provide feedback on proposed registrations. The reason to allow the Designated Experts to allocate values prior to publication as a final specification is to enable giving authors of specifications proposing registrations the benefit of review by the Designated Experts before the specification is completely done, so that if problems are identified, the authors can iterate and fix them before publication of the final specification.
